## The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of varying parameters on the accuracy of a K-Nearest neighbors prediction. We vary the number and quality of features as well as the hyperparameter(number of nearest neighbors) independently. Then we vary them in combination and make plots of our findings. Finally, we repeat the analysis with a k-fold cross validation algorithm

In this project, we will predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. You can read more about the data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile) and can download it directly from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data).
